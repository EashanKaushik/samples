## 🏁 Getting Started

### Step 1: Install Required Packages

```bash
pip install strands-agents
pip install strands-agents-tools
```

### Step 2: Setup Model Provider

Follow the instructions [here](https://strandsagents.com/0.1.x/user-guide/concepts/model-providers/amazon-bedrock/) to configure your model provider.

### Step 3: Build Your First Strands Agent

> ⚠️ **DISCLAIMER**
> This sample uses [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock) as the model provider, make sure to enable model access for Anthropic Claude 3.7, follow instructions [here](https://strandsagents.com/0.1.x/user-guide/concepts/model-providers/amazon-bedrock/).

```python
from strands import Agent, tool
from strands_tools import calculator, current_time, python_repl

@tool
def letter_counter(word: str, letter: str) -> int:
    """
    Count the occurrences of a specific letter in a word.
    """
    if not isinstance(word, str) or not isinstance(letter, str):
        return 0
    if len(letter) != 1:
        raise ValueError("The 'letter' parameter must be a single character")
    return word.lower().count(letter.lower())

agent = Agent(tools=[calculator, current_time, python_repl, letter_counter])

message = """
I have 4 requests:

1. What is the time right now?
2. Calculate 3111696 / 74088
3. Tell me how many letter R's are in the word "strawberry" 🍓
4. Output a script that does what we just spoke about!
   Use your python tools to confirm that the script works before outputting it
"""

agent(message)
```

### Step 4: Getting Started with the SDK

Start with the [01-getting-started](./01-getting-started/) directory.
Create your [first agent](./01-getting-started/00-first-agent/) and explore notebook-based examples covering core functionalities. Integrate agents with [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) servers, power your Strands Agents with open-source large language models running locally using [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), and so much more...

### Step 5: Explore ready to use samples
